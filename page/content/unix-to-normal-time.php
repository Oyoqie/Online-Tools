	<h3>Unix time</h3>
	<p>
		Unix time (also known as POSIX time or Epoch time) is a system for describing instants in time, defined as the number of seconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), Thursday, 1 January 1970, not counting leap seconds. It is used widely in Unix-like and many other operating systems and file formats. Because it does not handle leap seconds, it is neither a linear representation of time nor a true representation of UTC. Unix time may be checked on most Unix systems by typing <code>date +%s</code> on the command line. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time" target="_blank">Read more</a>

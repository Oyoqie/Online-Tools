<h1>About</h1>
<p class="lead">This page is a collection of online tools.</p>
<p>Someday I (<a href="http://www.timodenk.com" target="_blank">Timo Denk</a>) realized that there were plenty of little online tools I frequently used and everytime I searched anew for a website to accomplish them. E.g. I had to convert Unix timestamps into readable time format very often and converting RGB color values into HEX format was also a common task.</p>
<p>Since these tasks are pretty simple to implement I decided to write a simple website where I could add them and more online tools to have them all in one place with continuous design and functionality. My plan is to extend this website by and by with more and more tools to have a nice collection available.</p>

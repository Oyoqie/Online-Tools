<h1>About</h1>
<p class="lead">This page is a collection of online tools.</p>
<p>Someday I (<a href="http://www.timodenk.com" target="_blank">Timo Denk</a>) realized that there were plenty of little online tools I used frequently and whenever I needed them I had to search anew for a website to accomplish them. E.g. I had to convert Unix timestamps into readable time format very often and converting RGB color values into HEX format was also a common task.</p>
<p>Since these tasks are pretty simple to implement I decided to write a website where I could add those and more online tools to have them all in one place with continuous design and functionality. My plan is to extend this site by and by with more tools to have a nice collection available.</p>
<p>The whole website and all its tools are open source. <a href="https://github.com/Simsso/Online-Tools" target="_blank">You can find the source code on GitHub.</a></p>
